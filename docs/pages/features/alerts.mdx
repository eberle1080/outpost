title: Alerts
---

When a delivery attempt fails to deliver an event to a destination, an alert can be triggered. Alerts are scoped per destination.

Alerts can serve to notify the owner of the destination of the failure and to optionally auto-disable the destination using the `ALERT_AUTO_DISABLE_DESTINATION` config.

Instead of implementing user-facing alerting, alerts are produced on a callback URL configured through the `ALERT_CALLBACK_URL` variable. If the server does not respond with a `200`, there will be an exponential backoff, and the failure will be logged. Authentication is handled using the Admin API Key via a bearer token.

It's your responsibility to format and deliver the alert to your tenant using your existing notification system.

## Consecutive failure alerts

The `ALERT_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURE_COUNT` variable triggers an alert when the consecutive failure count reaches 50%, 70%, 90%, and 100%. At 100%, the destination will be disabled if the configuration is enabled.

}
